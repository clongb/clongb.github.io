  <body>
    <p>The About me page consists of various different HTML elements mostly taught from the <a href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/webfundamentals/HTML/toctree.html">Fundamentals of Web Programming</a>. There is a lot of hyperlinked text using href as well as the use of an unordered list in the "Things I like" section. To utilize the img tag in html, there is a section with "relevant media" with images related to the things I like, some resized to fit the page. There are several images under the third layer of heading with a caption for each, the beach one is even hyperlinked to a Google Maps location using <a href="https://github.com/clongb/clongb.github.io/commit/1f4884be6441ddc803ec472e0f7738cdd5afca3c#diff-803aebf51dbc2c943a0497ea3ac83678a0685acc84819a945bbf55d82e2f3e61">inline nesting</a>. For some however, different elements are used. Where there are Youtube embeds, Iframes are used based on the default settings Youtube provides when you copy their embed links. As for the yummy foods tier list, that is using table elements, which is very likely going to be updated by me in the near future since tables are more common in CSS.</p>
